### Project Details

The purpose of this project is to provide prompts for usage with ChatGPT. Each text file in the repository contains a prompt that you can copy and paste into the ChatGPT chat for generating text. Instructions and other information about each prompt can be found in each text file of the chosen prompt.

Please make sure that each prompt is used ethically and also please avoid generating illegal content. When ChatGPT is used for illegal purposes, it can result in fines and others. Please test explicit and illegal topics like malware in sandbox environments.

### Restrictions by ChatGPT using a prompt (ATTENTION, READ THIS WHOLE THING)

Some prompts may be restricted by OpenAI because of going against the OpenAI rules. It may go and display a warning by ChatGPT, saying that it's explicit, illegal and even unethical. When ChatGPT provides more information than what the prompt asked or ChatGPT doesn't generate it, then you should refresh the generated text (at the bottom-right corner, near the text box).

### Special Thanks

Special thanks to ChatGPT and OpenAI for making the prompt generation and usage possible. These prompts are made for the user, so the user can do what he needs and also have prompts, so he doesn't have to type them.
